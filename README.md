This is a web application for sharing the environmental conditions of your area like cleanliness, air quality, etc with other people on the platform and to learn about climate change, pollution and other environment degrading factors.  
# 💬 Description  
Note: i made this repo when i was only 12 as a fun project so there is a high chance of UI issues and bad coding practices, project not working at all and what not.  
So the 💡 **idea** behind this project was simple to create a **platform** where people can learn about how to make their environment better and share the environment conditions of their area so other people can get inspired to do the same and share it with others.  
# 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack  
I used html and css with javascript for frontend.  
I used firebase for authentication and storing data.  
# 📲 Usage  
I don't think you would want to clone it considering all the things i mentioned above but still if you want to then go ahead.  
To use it you would have to just open the index.html file on your favorite browser.  

Thanks for taking the time to check this repo  
Keep coding
